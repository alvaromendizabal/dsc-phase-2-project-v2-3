We developed a model that can predict the price of home with 81% accuracy 

We tested multiple models and combinations and found sqft living and location 

were the most important features in assesing home values. 



The view on the property and grade recieved were also key features in determing price. 

That means give us those 4 features and we can figure out the price of a home and only be off by about $50 thousand

Armed with knowledge you could figure out your commissions and how much a home should be listed for! (Next slide)




Here we can see an aerial view of Maple Valley. Each circle represents a 1/5. So for example. 

Red is the 80-100% price range, purple is the 60-80%, blue is the 40-60%, and yellow is the bottom 20%. 

These properties arent very expensive and would yield smaller commissions. (Next slide)






But we can show you a hot market with numerious upper tier properties. 

Remember red and purple represent the 60-100% price range. Green Lake always has listings. 

It's proximity to Univesities could be why homeowners sell more often. Now to show you that, this is snapshot of 2015. (Next slide)






For 2022 we see the same trend playing out. Just for reference, the median price of homes sold in zipcodes 

neighboring Green Lake was 580k in 15 and today it's just over a million. 

Our model is so accurate that it predicted the listing price of a typical home in Green Lake to be 960k. 

These are the places Compass can focus their manpower and advertisting. Next Nic will dive into which areas 

would make best use of marketing dollars and labor
